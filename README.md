## Communication

* I'm OK with Slack. In fact, I like to chat over Slack often and at lenght.
* I will want to meet you face-to-face if I see there is potentially room for ambiguity.
* Or I will ask you to "jump on a call with me" when I feel like something needs sorting out sooner than later.
* I tend to over-communicate things to make sure people are on the same page.
* I will probably ask a lot of questions. I ask them because I'm curious and I'm looking for other people's perspectives on something.
* If I question something it's not because I disagree but because I like to challenge ideas and discuss them. It may sometimes look like I'm arguing - I'm not. The fact is, the more engaged I am in a conversation the more it means I'm curious and I want to get deeper into the subject. I mainly do that so that we can look at problems and solutions from different angles. My intention is to test the original idea and to potentially come up with something even better collaboratively.
* I will assume I can trust you and I will be transparent with you. I don't want to play politics but I can if I'm forced to.
* I will treat you as a partner and I expect the same whatever level you are.

## Feedback

* I'm OK with direct feedback. I'm not OK with someone being an asshole.
* I actually love to receive feedback if there is something you think I can improve. Feel free to give me one.
* I will likely give you very honest and direct feedback as well. Most likely more honest than what you'd typically hear.
* If I disagree with something I will tell you. I expect the same in return. Don't worry to tell me if you disagree. That's OK. I'm open to debating stuff.

## Meetings

* Meetings I create will have agendas and intentions. I like to know what meetings I attend and I try being explicit when I invite others.
* I like if meetings end with action items and if we know who owns those actions.
* Meetings need decision makers.
* If we can solve it on Slack with one message, we don't need a meeting.
* I will be on-time. If I'm not, call me out. I try to be and hope others will be as well.
* My calendar is up-to-date - feel free to schedule a meeting.
* Also, give me a shout if you want to jump on an ad-hoc meeting.

## Work style

* I thrive doing creative work. I will manage repetitive for a while but won't sustain in chore-mode too long.
* I will find an opportunity to learn in anything I do. And I will take notes. I take a shitload of notes and I like to write. If I had the time to organise stuff, I'd probably have enough material for several books by now.
* If you give me a challenging task I will first research it. I like to know what are the options. I will try to undestand the problem at its core, then design, and implement.
* I will spend some time on research and design but I don't like to waste time and I will be putting together a prototype as soon as I can.
* To give an example. If you told me to build a phone simulator I would first want to read what a PBX is and how telecommunication works. Or if you told me to design a company career page my reasearch will probably lead me to reading about Employer Branding and doing the "Persona Archetype" exercise first (both happened)
* I love to work with others. I found to be most productive when "pair programming" a solution with someone.

## Availability

* I typically work between 10am - 6pm (Poland) and I reserve time outside of this window for my family.
* I'm OK to meet outside those hours but let's not make it a norm. I will respect your preferred hours likewise.
* As a rule, I don't work over-hours. I actually do but not because someone asked me to. I wouldn't want my team mates to work extra hours w/o being paid extra or getting extra shares. I consider asking people to work extra hours (systematically) a toxic and abusive bahaviour.
* Similarly, I don't work on weekends ("weekend" is figurative here). Life is too short for that. I would not ask my team mates to work over a weekend. If we have to, it means we screwed up planning stuff.
* The fact I don't work after 6PM don't mean I don't read stuff you write on Slack on email ;) I probably will and will sometimes reply. If it's something urgent and I see it I will reply.

## Northstars

* **By default, people want to do a good job** - I found that they fail mostly if they don't have the right setup. Or if they have poor managers.
* **People are lead, tasks are managed** - it's a phrase I heard once and I truly believe. I don't believe in managers. I believe in leaders.
* **Time is your most precious resource** - we all have only one life. Most of us will have more than one job. I believe it's smart to prioritise life over your job because the latter is much easier to change. On the flip side, the higher your life quality is, the better you can perform in your job and it becomes part of your life.
* **I turn chaos into order** - I like organising stuff. I like taking complex problems and finding patterns. I will try to find ways to simplify things.
* **Focus on output vs input** - I don't care when other people work as longs as they are happy and productive.
* **Money is means to a goal - adding value is the goal** - in context of orgs
* **All people have talents**

## Chris The Human Being

* You know I used to code for most of my life.
* Father of Ann. Husband of Anita :)
* My goal is to have the luxury of not having any goals while still having a purpose.
* I'm a big fan of learning new stuff and reading. I wanted to learn how to cook - I watched the entire (100h) course on cooking online and really got into fundamentals. I wanted to learn about investing - I studied Benjamin Graham and read economics course books. Wanted to learn piano - studied math behind it and music theory. Same with psychology, management, leadership, etc.
* Several years ago I got into real-estate investing a lot. I'm currently still investing in my "free time" - mostly stock, bonds and crypto.
* If I didnt write code or do people stuff at Briza I could: write books, build a business.
* I wish I could paint and draw. I once thought I would be a good artist.

## Average Day

* Whenever I can I will start my day with planning my day's calendar.
* I will first take on analytical tasks or tasks that requires synthesis.
* Meetings and collaborating energize me.
* Too many meetings / day drain me.
* Mid of day / after lunch is perfect for meetings.
* I'm most productive in the morning.
* I'm most creative very late at night.

## Quirks

* I'm quite allergic to toxic organisations. I'm also allergic to pollen.
* I get emotional about things. The upside of this is that I seem to be sensitive to other people's emotions and can read them quite well. Downside is that I will sometimes over-react or maybe say or write something w/o giving it the time to rest.
* If it sometimes feel like I'm a control-freak, I admit I have a dendency to control stuff. Maybe that's why I like processes so much. That also means I may freak out occasionally when things change suddenly. I will adapt quite quickly overall but I my initially over-react. It's something I'm working on and if you know how to improve on that - please tell me :)
* I can be difficult to manage. I don't like the idea of being told what to do. I like to know why we do things.
* I love to work with smart, creative people who can experiment, innovate and dare to change the status quo.
* I'm (used to be?) the guy who has a question in a room full of people even when no-one else has.
* A rose is a rose is a rose. Yes is yes, no is no. I'm a simple guy. And I like literature.
* I like sharing knowledge.
* I feel energized when I'm networking.
* I can get impatient
* I can have high heights and low lows sometimes - I don't think I have a bipolar disorder though
* My memory is weaker than my logic. That's why I choose computer science over medicine. For example, I never remembered math equations but I was always able to derive most of them.
* I will make mistaks :)
